### Where to start

## What you just did
- Updated the items document to have a created_by and requested_by key
- Added a requests controller which has an index method showing all items which have been requested


## Things to fix
- Remove the assocataion with the user from the item model. 
- In the store, retrieve the user info from the item document instead of searching

## Next step
- Add a method to the requests controller which adds a request to an item
- Add a link to the item store which submits the request
